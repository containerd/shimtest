# shimtest

A conformance test suite for containerd shim implementations. Tests the task
lifecycle (create, start, exec, kill, delete), stdio round-trip, clock
synchronization across a VM boundary, the transfer service, and UDS socket
forwarding.

shimtest is part of the [nerdbox](https://github.com/containerd/nerdbox) non-core sub-project of [containerd](https://github.com/containerd).

## Prerequisites

- A built shim binary (e.g., `containerd-shim-runc-v2` or
  `containerd-shim-nerdbox-v1`)
- Go toolchain (for compiling the test binary and `cmd/testbin`)

No containerd daemon is required. The test rootfs is built in-process from
an embedded Go binary (`cmd/testbin`) compressed as `_output/testbin.gz` and
written into an erofs image at test time.

## Building

```bash
make build
```

This builds `cmd/testbin` (a small multicall binary embedded in the test
rootfs) and compiles the test binary to `_output/shimtest.test`. The testbin
is always cross-compiled for `linux/amd64` via `CGO_ENABLED=0`; override with
`TESTBIN_GOOS`/`TESTBIN_GOARCH` or drop a pre-built `_output/testbin.gz` in
place before `make build`.

## Configuration

Tests are driven by one or more JSON configuration files. See
`shimtest.config.sample.json` for all options. The key fields are:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `shim_binary` | string | Name or path of the shim binary to test (required) |
| `uid` | int | UID to run as; defaults to the current user's UID. If set to a value different from the current UID and the effective UID is 0, the harness re-execs itself as that user via `sudo` |
| `gid` | int | GID to run as |
| `format_mounts` | bool | Provide the rootfs as formatted erofs/ext4 images with a `format/mkdir/overlay` descriptor for the shim to mount. Default (`false`) extracts the rootfs and provides a pre-mounted overlay (or plain directory when rootless) |
| `provide_network` | bool | Have `NetworkSuite` set up a container's network connectivity itself (a dedicated network namespace plus a `slirp4netns` process attached to it) instead of assuming the shim already gives containers a working default network path. Leave `false` for shims with real networking of their own (e.g. VM-based shims); set `true` only for shims with no network setup at all, which otherwise leave a container in an empty, unconfigured network namespace. Requires `slirp4netns` on `PATH`; skipped otherwise |
| `skip` | []string | Feature names to skip (`exec`, `layers`, `net`, `oom`, `sandbox`, `transfer`, `uds`) |
| `env` | map | Additional environment variables for the test run |
| `debug` | bool | Enable debug logging on the shim |

## Running

shimtest runs in one of two modes.

### Single config

```bash
_output/shimtest.test -test.v -shimtest.config=profiles/myconfig.json
```

### Config directory

All `*.json` files in the directory are loaded; each becomes a subtest named
after the file:

```bash
_output/shimtest.test -test.v -shimtest.configdir=profiles/
```

Configs with a `uid` that doesn't match the current process are skipped, or
re-exec'd via `sudo` when the effective UID is 0. The parent serializes the
full config into a temp file and passes it to the child so no fields are
lost across the re-exec.

### Examples

```bash
# Run a single test case in a single config
_output/shimtest.test -test.v -test.run='TestShim/myconfig/Lifecycle' \
  -shimtest.config=profiles/myconfig.json

# Run all configs in profiles/
sudo _output/shimtest.test -test.v -shimtest.configdir=profiles/

# Run StartupPhases benchmark across all configs (benchtime=3x is quick)
_output/shimtest.test -test.run='^$' \
  -test.bench='BenchmarkShim/[^/]+/StartupPhases' -test.benchtime=3x \
  -shimtest.configdir=profiles/
```

## Tests

All tests are subtests of the single entry point `TestShim`. Within each
config, the tree is `TestShim/<config-name>/<test-name>`.

| Test | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Lifecycle` | — | Full create/start/kill/wait/delete cycle |
| `Exec` | exec | Exec a process inside a running container |
| `StdioRoundTrip` | exec | Write to stdin, read from stdout via exec |
| `LargeStdioRoundTrip` | exec | Pipe 20 MiB through stdin→`cat`→stdout via exec; verify full byte count and CRC-32. Catches truncation in the exec stdio pipeline under sustained load |
| `StdinDetachReattach` | exec | Write to an exec's stdin, close the local write end without CloseIO (detach), then open a new writer on the same stdin path (re-attach) and write again; verify both writes reach stdout. Only an explicit CloseIO may deliver stdin EOF |
| `Clock` | exec | Verify VM clock is synchronized with host |
| `ExitCodes` | exec | Exec processes that exit with a range of status codes and verify propagation |
| `InitExitCodes` | — | Run the container's init process with `/bin/exit N` and verify task-level exit status propagation |
| `OutputThenExit` | — | Run a process that prints 50 lines over 50ms then exits non-zero; verify both exit status and every line of output |
| `FastExitInit` | — | Run the container's init as `/bin/burstexit 8MiB 0`; call Delete immediately after Wait (no drain pause); verify full byte count and CRC-32. Regression test for the close-before-drain race in `io.go` (init path) |
| `Events` | — | Bind a TTRPC events recorder at `TTRPC_ADDRESS` and verify the shim publishes `create`, `start`, `exit`, `delete` events with correct fields |
| `FastExitOutput` | exec | Exec `/bin/burstexit 8MiB 0` and call Delete immediately after Wait; verify full byte count and CRC-32. Regression test for the close-before-drain race in `io.go` (exec path) |
| `LargeFileRead` | exec | Read a 64 MiB fixture from a secondary read-only erofs layer, verify crc32-Castagnoli, report MiB/s |
| `BindMountRead` | exec | Bind-mount the same 64 MiB fixture from a host tempfile and verify+benchmark via the bind path |
| `OOM` | oom | Run a memory hog under a 128MiB limit and verify the kernel OOM-kills it (exit 137) |
| `HundredLayers` | layers | Build a rootfs with 100 stacked erofs layers — layer 1 seeds 99 files in `/base` and adds `/added/file_1`; layers 2..100 each add `/added/file_K` and white out `/base/base_{K-2}`. Verify all 100 added files are present and all 99 base files are gone. Only meaningful with `format_mounts=true` (the shim assembles the multi-layer overlay itself); skipped otherwise |
| `TransferCopyTo` | transfer | Copy a file into a container |
| `TransferCopyToAndFrom` | transfer | Copy a file in and back out |
| `TransferExecVerify` | transfer | Copy a file in, verify via exec |
| `UDSRoundTrip` | uds | UDS socket forwarding round-trip |
| `OutboundTCP` | net | A container's init process opens an outbound TCP connection to a host-reachable endpoint and completes a round trip. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular networking mechanism, only that a container has working default outbound TCP connectivity, as "host networking" would provide. |
| `OutboundUDP` | net | A container's init process exchanges a UDP datagram with a host-reachable endpoint. Same neutrality as `OutboundTCP`, for the datagram path. |
| `DNSResolve` | net | A container's init process resolves a real external hostname (`example.com`, forcing an actual DNS query — not answered from `/etc/hosts`) and gets back valid IP addresses. Requires outbound internet access from the test host. |
| `InboundTCPListen` | net | A container's init process binds a TCP listener on a concrete port chosen by the test (never one discovered from the container's own output, which some shims cannot reliably report — see pickHostPort), and the host-side test connects to it and confirms the container actually received the data. With `provide_network`, the test also registers its own port forward before the container even starts. Verifies the inbound (listen/accept) side of the default networking contract: ports bound inside the container must be reachable from the host. |
| `LoopbackWithinContainer` | net | A container's init process binds a listener on 127.0.0.1 and connects to it from within the same container over loopback. Verifies that the container's loopback interface works; a prerequisite for between-container localhost connectivity when containers share a network namespace. |
| `Lifecycle` | sandbox | Full sandbox lifecycle: `CreateSandbox` → `StartSandbox` → `SandboxStatus`(ready) → `StopSandbox` → `SandboxStatus`(stopped) → `ShutdownSandbox`. Verifies state transitions and that the bootstrap version is ≥ 3. Linux only. |
| `Platform` | sandbox | `Platform` RPC returns a non-empty OS and Architecture. Linux only. |
| `Ping` | sandbox | `PingSandbox` succeeds while the sandbox is running. Linux only. |
| `SingleContainer` | sandbox | One member container created on the shared connection produces expected output and exits cleanly. Linux only. |
| `MultipleContainers` | sandbox | Three member containers run concurrently in one sandbox VM, each with isolated rootfs and independent output. Linux only. |
| `ContainerLifecycleIndependence` | sandbox | Deleting one member container leaves the sandbox and other containers running; `SandboxStatus` remains ready. Linux only. |
| `StatusAfterStop` | sandbox | `SandboxStatus` after `StopSandbox` does not report ready; a second `StopSandbox` is idempotent. Linux only. |
| `WaitUnblocksOnStop` | sandbox | `WaitSandbox` returns within 15 s after `StopSandbox`. Linux only. |
| `CreateTwiceRejected` | sandbox | A second `CreateSandbox` on the same shim process returns `AlreadyExists`. Linux only. |
| `StartWithoutCreateRejected` | sandbox | `StartSandbox` before `CreateSandbox` returns `FailedPrecondition`. Linux only. |
| `ResourceReleaseOnShutdown` | sandbox | After `ShutdownSandbox`, no per-container mount points remain in the shim's mount namespace. Linux only. |
| `Stress` | (per feature) | Long-running concurrent stress run. Composes subtests from the enabled features (Transfer, Sandbox). Each subtest runs as a goroutine until the test deadline approaches or any one fails (which cancels the rest). Skipped under `-test.short`. The Sandbox subtest also checks host RSS growth and mount-point leaks after each run. |

A separate top-level fuzz target exists alongside `TestShim`:

| Fuzz target | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FuzzTransferMissing` | transfer | Fuzzes the transfer service's not-found path. Without `-fuzz` only the seed corpus runs (sub-second); with `-fuzz=FuzzTransferMissing` it generates new inputs continuously until `-fuzztime` elapses or a failing input is found. |

### Planned tests

Candidates to add later, ranked roughly by value:

- **Signals** — send SIGTERM (not SIGKILL) to init, verify exit 143. Most shims get KILL right but botch non-KILL forwarding.
- **Pause/Resume** — pause a ticker process, verify output stops; resume, verify it continues.
- **Stats** — call `tc.Stats()` and assert cgroup counters populate (probe since not all shims implement it).
- **Missing executable** — set `Args` to a nonexistent path and verify a clean error (not a hang or panic).
- **Cold-cache IO** — `LargeFileRead`/`BindMountRead` currently measure warm-cache throughput. A cold-cache variant would need to drop caches between runs (root only) or grow the fixture beyond cache size.
- **Double-kill / post-exit API** — Kill after exit; Wait/State after Delete. Idempotency.
- **Zombie reaping** — init that forks and exits; verify the shim's pid 1 reaps the orphan.

## Benchmarks

A subset of these benchmarks runs against `runc-rootless` and `nerdbox`
on every push to `main` and is published as time-series charts at
<https://containerd.github.io/shimtest/dev/bench/> (gh-pages).


Benchmarks live under `BenchmarkShim/<config-name>/<bench-name>`.

| Benchmark | Feature | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Lifecycle` | — | Full container create/start/kill/wait/delete cycle |
| `Startup` | — | Shim start through first output |
| `StartupPhases` | — | Same as `Startup` with per-phase breakdown reported via custom metrics (`ms/shim-start`, `ms/connect`, `ms/create`, `ms/task-start`, `ms/output`, `ms/total`) |
| `Start` | — | Shim start subcommand only (bootstrap, no container) |
| `Exec` | exec | Exec cycle inside a running container (exec/start/wait/delete) |
| `StdioRoundTrip` | exec | Stdio write/read at 8B, 4KB, 4MB |
| `UDSRoundTrip` | uds | UDS forwarded-socket throughput in both directions (HostToContainer, ContainerToHost) at 8B, 4KB, 4MB |
| `ThirtyLayers` | layers | Bring up a container with a 30-layer erofs rootfs (same shape as `HundredLayers`, smaller). Reports per-phase metrics (`ms/shim-start`, `ms/create`, `ms/task-start`, `ms/total`) so multi-layer mount overhead can be localized. Requires `format_mounts=true` |
| `ContainerCreate` | sandbox | Per-container create/start/wait/delete cycle inside a single shared sandbox VM. The sandbox is started once before the `b.N` loop; each iteration adds one member container, runs it to completion, and removes it. Reports `ms/create`, `ms/start`, `ms/wait`, `ms/delete`, `ms/total`, and `ms/sandbox-start` (one-time amortised cost). Compare `ms/create` and `ms/total` with `RunSuite.Lifecycle` to quantify the marginal cost of a sandbox container versus a fresh-VM container. Linux only. |

### Member-container workload contracts

These tests (all gated on the `sandbox` feature) verify the shim API contract for member-container workloads: status fields, host-network sandboxes, exec, shared endpoints, shared namespaces, volumes, and network scoping.

| Test | Feature | Linux only | Verifies |
|---|---|---|---|
| `StatusReportsPidAndCreatedAt` | sandbox | no | `SandboxStatus` returns a non-zero `pid` and a non-zero `created_at` after `StartSandbox`. Both let a caller reference the sandbox's namespaces (`/proc/<pid>/ns/*`) and report its age (e.g. as CRI's `PodSandboxStatus.CreatedAt` does). `SandboxStatus.Info` must carry `pid` and `state` entries. |
| `HostNetworkNoNetworkSandbox` | sandbox | no | A sandbox created with an empty `netns_path` (no network sandbox provided) must succeed. Member containers must run normally. The shim must accept the no-isolation case without error. |
| `MemberContainerExec` | sandbox | no | `Task.Exec` + `Task.Start(ExecID)` must run an additional process inside a running member container with correct output and exit-status propagation. Underpins any exec-into-a-running-container use case (interactive exec, health probes, sidecar tooling). |
| `CrossContainerViaUDS` | sandbox | yes | Two exec processes running inside a sandbox member container both connect to a shared host-side UNIX domain socket forwarded in via the `uds` mount type. Proves that multiple processes in a sandbox can reach a common host-forwarded endpoint. |
| `NetworkSandboxHeldOpen` | sandbox | yes | When a non-empty `netns_path` is provided in `CreateSandboxRequest`, the shim must hold the network sandbox resource open for the sandbox lifetime. The path must remain reachable while the sandbox is ready and must be releasable after `StopSandbox`. No special privileges required. |
| `NetworkSandboxPathInStatus` | sandbox | yes | If a network sandbox path was provided in `CreateSandboxRequest`, `SandboxStatus.Info["networkSandboxPath"]` should report the same path. Informational (absence does not hard-fail); the field is optional in the base protocol. No special privileges required. |
| `ContainerOutboundTCP` | sandbox | no | A process exec'd into a member container must be able to resolve a real external hostname, proving it has a working outbound network path. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular networking mechanism (native netns, virtual NIC, or otherwise). DNS is used here (rather than a raw TCP round trip) because `Task.Exec` has no stdin plumbing; `NetworkSuite` separately covers TCP and UDP round trips end-to-end on the legacy path. No special privileges required. |
| `ContainerTrafficScopedToNetworkSandbox` | sandbox | yes | When a non-empty `netns_path` is provided, a member container's outbound traffic must actually originate from within that network sandbox, not merely have the path pinned open. Uses a veth pair fully contained in a real network namespace (unreachable from outside it) as a falsifiable probe: a successful round trip is only possible if the container's traffic originates inside the sandbox. Requires root (CAP_SYS_ADMIN) to create the namespace and interfaces; skipped otherwise. |
| `InboundToNetnsScopedListener` | sandbox | yes | The inbound mirror of `ContainerTrafficScopedToNetworkSandbox`: a member container binds an ephemeral TCP listener (port discovered via its stdout) and must be reachable by a caller connecting from inside the same network sandbox namespace. The same veth-pair-isolated address is used as a falsifiable probe: only a caller inside the sandbox can reach the listener. Requires root (CAP_SYS_ADMIN); skipped otherwise. Linux only. |
| `MemberContainersShareNetwork` | sandbox | yes | Member containers of the same sandbox must share a network stack: a listener started by one member container (on an ephemeral port discovered at runtime via its stdout) must be reachable from a second, independently created member container via loopback (127.0.0.1), with no explicit network configuration on either container. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular mechanism (a real shared network namespace, a shared virtual interface, or any other approach). No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainerHostVolume` | sandbox | yes | A member container's OCI spec may include a "bind" mount referencing a host directory (e.g. as CRI's hostPath volumes or Kubernetes `RecursiveReadOnly=false` bind mounts produce). The shim must honor it as a live, two-way share, not a one-time copy: a file updated on the host after the container has already started must become visible inside it. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular sharing mechanism. No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainersSharePID` | sandbox | yes | When a member container's OCI spec carries a host path on its PID namespace entry (e.g. as a caller uses to express Kubernetes' `shareProcessNamespace: true` or `hostPID: true`), the shim must place that container in a PID namespace shared with its sandbox peers. A process started in one member container must be visible — by PID and argv — via `/proc` in a second, independently created member container. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular sharing mechanism. No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainersSharePIDKillScopedToOwnContainer` | sandbox | yes | The converse safety property to `MemberContainersSharePID`: `Task.Kill` and `Task.Pids` identify processes by container ID (and, for `Kill`, exec ID) — never by a raw PID, which the request shape doesn't even carry — so they must stay scoped to the named container even though its processes are visible to, and share a namespace with, its sandbox peers. Killing one member container with `All: true` must not affect a peer sharing the same PID namespace. No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainersShareIPC` | sandbox | yes | When a member container's OCI spec carries a host path on its IPC namespace entry (e.g. as a caller uses to express Kubernetes' default of always sharing one IPC namespace across a pod's containers), the shim must place that container in an IPC namespace shared with its sandbox peers. A SysV shared memory segment created by one member container must be visible — by its well-known key — to a second, independently created member container. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular sharing mechanism. No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainersShareDevShm` | sandbox | yes | Member containers sharing an IPC namespace (see `MemberContainersShareIPC`) must also get a shared `/dev/shm`, even though every member container's OCI spec carries the exact same, independent-looking `{Type: "tmpfs", Destination: "/dev/shm"}` mount with no separate "shared" signal. A POSIX-shared-memory-style write made through an `mmap(MAP_SHARED)` mapping by one member container must be visible through an independent mapping in a second, independently created member container. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular sharing mechanism. No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainersDevShmNotSharedWithoutIPC` | sandbox | yes | The converse of `MemberContainersShareDevShm`: a member container that does not request IPC sharing must get its own private `/dev/shm`, even though its OCI spec's `/dev/shm` mount is identical in shape to a sharing container's. Guards against a shim inferring sharing from the mount's shape rather than the IPC-sharing signal. No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainerOOMIsolation` | sandbox | yes | The OOM-specific counterpart to `ContainerLifecycleIndependence` (which only covers a peer's graceful exit): when the kernel OOM-kills one member container (a memory-limited container running a memory-hungry workload, as in the standalone `OOM` test), a sibling member container with no memory limit must be unaffected, and the sandbox itself must remain ready. No special privileges required. |
| `MemberContainersShareUTS` | sandbox | yes | When a member container's OCI spec carries a host path on its UTS namespace entry (e.g. as a caller uses to express Kubernetes' default of sharing one hostname across a pod's containers), the shim must place that container in a UTS namespace shared with its sandbox peers. A hostname change made via `sethostname(2)` (the standard `hostname <name>` command) by one member container must be visible — via the kernel-reported hostname, not a file — to a second, independently created member container, even after the first container has exited, proving the shared namespace is owned by the sandbox rather than tied to the setter's lifetime. Implementation-neutral: does not assume any particular sharing mechanism. The container requests `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` explicitly since the base container spec grants no capabilities; the test is skipped, not failed, if the shim does not grant it. |
| `MemberContainersUTSNotShared` | sandbox | yes | The converse of `MemberContainersShareUTS`: a member container that does not request UTS sharing must not observe a peer's hostname change, even though both belong to the same sandbox. Guards against a shim sharing UTS namespaces merely because containers are sandbox peers, rather than because sharing was requested. |

## Using shimtest in your shim's CI

To run shimtest as part of your own shim project's CI, your job needs
to: build your shim, check out and build shimtest, write a JSON profile
that points at your binary, then run `shimtest.test` against it.

### Minimal workflow snippet

```yaml
- name: Build my shim
  run: |
    make my-shim   # produces ./bin/containerd-shim-myshim-v1
    echo "$(pwd)/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH

- name: Allow unprivileged user namespaces
  # Only needed if your profile uses a non-zero uid on Ubuntu 24.04+.
  run: sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0

- name: Check out shimtest
  uses: actions/checkout@de0fac2e4500dabe0009e67214ff5f5447ce83dd # v6.0.2
  with:
    repository: containerd/shimtest
    ref: <commit-sha>   # pin a commit
    path: shimtest

- name: Setup Go
  uses: actions/setup-go@4a3601121dd01d1626a1e23e37211e3254c1c06c # v6.4.0
  with:
    go-version: "1.26.x"

- name: Build shimtest
  working-directory: shimtest
  run: make build

- name: Write shimtest profile
  run: |
    cat > shimtest/myshim.json <<'EOF'
    {
      "shim_binary": "containerd-shim-myshim-v1",
      "skip": ["transfer", "uds"]
    }
    EOF

- name: Run shimtest
  working-directory: shimtest
  run: |
    _output/shimtest.test -test.v -test.short -test.timeout=300s \
      -shimtest.config=myshim.json
```

The `-test.short` flag opts out of the long-running `Stress` test;
the fuzz target's seed corpus runs either way (it's fast). Drop
`-test.short` from a separate nightly/soak job to exercise the
unbounded `Stress` run, and run active fuzzing as its own step:

```yaml
- name: Run shimtest soak (nightly)
  working-directory: shimtest
  run: |
    _output/shimtest.test -test.v -test.timeout=15m \
      -test.run='TestShim/myshim/Stress' \
      -shimtest.config=myshim.json
    # Active fuzzing in a separate step:
    _output/shimtest.test -test.run='^$' \
      -test.fuzz=FuzzTransferMissing -test.fuzztime=10m \
      -test.fuzzcachedir=$RUNNER_TEMP/fuzzcache \
      -shimtest.config=myshim.json
```

### What you'll need to configure

- **`shim_binary`**: bare name (resolved via `PATH`) or absolute path.
  shimtest also adds the binary's directory to `PATH` so sibling
  helpers (kernels, libraries) co-located with the shim resolve.
- **`format_mounts`**: set `true` if your shim mounts the rootfs
  itself from `format/mkdir/overlay` descriptors (VM-based shims);
  leave `false` to receive a pre-mounted overlay or plain directory.
- **`uid`**: omit to run as the runner user. Set explicitly when you
  want the harness to `sudo` re-exec itself or rewrite the profile.
- **`skip`**: list of feature names to disable. Currently meaningful
  values are `exec`, `layers`, `net`, `oom`, `sandbox`, `transfer`, and `uds` —
  useful when your shim doesn't implement transfer/UDS forwarding,
  multi-layer rootfs descriptors, or when running rootless without
  cgroup delegation.

### Multiple configs

If you want one job to test several profiles (e.g., rootless and root
variants of the same shim) put the JSON files under a directory and
pass `-shimtest.configdir=` instead of `-shimtest.config=`. Each file
becomes a `TestShim/<filename>/...` subtest. Profiles whose `uid`
differs from the running process are skipped, or `sudo`-re-exec'd
when the harness is running as root.

### Benchmarks

The benchmark binary is the same as the test binary — just point
`-test.bench` at the suite and disable tests:

```yaml
- name: Run benchmarks
  working-directory: shimtest
  run: |
    _output/shimtest.test -test.run='^$' \
      -test.bench='BenchmarkShim/myshim/(Lifecycle|Startup|Exec)' \
      -test.benchtime=5x \
      -shimtest.config=myshim.json | tee bench.txt
```
